# AcerAN515-58LinuxBrightnessBypass

This will make the inbuilt brightness controls work. both the slider and the function keys.
I've tested this on a live boot usb, running Linux mint and it works right out of the box.

all you need to do is download the files, and extract them. then run the commands

chmod 755 install_brightness_bypass.sh

./install_brightness_bypass.sh

it will ask you for your password, like any script that uses sudo. After you enter you password and the script runs, you'll be able to use the built in brightness controls in Linux mint, and the function keys.

Do note this will not work out of the box with Ubuntu. I tested.
